# Is a subset smaller than the whole
  - Draw some smaller sets on the board
    - Subsets seem to be smaller...
  - But what about even numbers?
    -
# Pidgeons and Hotels
  - Pidgeonhole principle
    - Can't fit 1+n pidgeons into n holes without sharing
    - Draw it a few times?
  - Breaks down in infinite case
    - Consider a hotel with a neverending hallway
      - Rooms are all occupied
    - New tennant shows up
      - What to do?
      - Move everyone over one, it's all good
      - Always another room to go to - it's infinite
    - Several (n) new tennants show up
      - Move everyone over n rooms
    - Another infinite number of guests appears!
      - How would we solve this problem?
      - Move everyone in room (n) to room (2n)
      - Assign each new guest a number, tell them to go to room 2n+1
      - No collisions, rooms for everyone
    - Our problems have gotten worse...
      - An infinite number of busses appear
      - They all contain infinitely many guests
      - What are we to do?
        - Give each bus a number (i)
        - Each guest has a number within their bus (j)
        - Think of them as in a grid of all (i,j)
        - Winding map to numbers
# Consequences for sizing infinite sets
  - Clearly these sets are in some sense the same size
  - After all, they both "fit" inside the elements of the other
# Countabillity?
  - Can we count every set?
    - Don't worry, I'm not going to pull another paradox
  - Integers?
    - Make them guess
  - The rationals (fractions)?
    - Make them guess
      - Turns out to be easier than the infinite bus scenario
  - The reals?
    - Hmm...
